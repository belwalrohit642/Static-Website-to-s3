step1- Simple static website(html,css,javascript) hosted in a git repository.
step2- Set up a CI process using a CI/CD tool (jenkins).
       CI process should do the following: Clone the repository,Build the web application,Run the basic tests(eg check if html and css is valid).If the test pass, create a build artifact.
step3- Implement a CD process that deploys the web application  to  a simple web server or cloud storage whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.
step4- Monitoring : implement basic monitoring or logging to track the status of the deployment process.
